### **Phase 5: Deployment**
**Objective**: Host the application online for demonstration purposes.

**Steps**:

#### **1. Backend (Laravel) Deployment**
1. **Set Up Hosting**:
   - Log in to Hostinger and access your hosting dashboard.
   - Ensure your hosting plan supports **PHP** and **MySQL**.
2. **Upload Laravel Project**:
   - Zip your Laravel project (excluding the `node_modules` and `vendor` folders).
   - Upload it via the **File Manager** or using **FTP** (e.g., FileZilla).
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Use Hostinger‚Äôs **SSH Access** to connect to the server.
   - Run the following commands to install dependencies:
     ```bash
     composer install
     php artisan key:generate
     php artisan migrate
     ```
4. **Database Setup**:
   - Create a database via the Hostinger control panel.
   - Update the `.env` file with the database credentials.
5. **Point Domain to Public Folder**:
   - Configure the **public_html** folder to point to Laravel‚Äôs `public` directory.
   - Update the `.htaccess` file to redirect all traffic to Laravel‚Äôs public folder.

#### **2. Frontend (React) Deployment**
1. **Build the React App**:
   - In your React project, run:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - This generates a `build` folder with production-ready files.
2. **Upload Build Files**:
   - Upload the contents of the `build` folder to a subdomain or a separate folder (e.g., `frontend`) on Hostinger.
3. **Connect Backend and Frontend**:
   - Update the API endpoints in your React app to point to your Laravel backend URL.

#### **3. Domain Configuration**
1. **Link Domain to Project**:
   - Go to your Hostinger dashboard and set up the domain to point to the correct folders:
     - Backend: Point to the folder containing Laravel‚Äôs `public` directory.
     - Frontend: Point to the folder containing the React `build` files.
2. **SSL Certificate**:
   - Enable SSL for your domain via Hostinger to ensure secure communication.

#### **4. Test Your Application**
- Access your domain in a browser to verify both the frontend and backend are working.
- Test all features to ensure the deployment is successful.
